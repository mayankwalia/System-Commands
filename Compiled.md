## Week 1 Notes 

### Terminal Emulators 
* Terminal
* Konsole
* xterm

  `- 1` : each file name on a separate line
  - output of `ls -l` : `drwxr-xr-x 5 ckg ckg 12288 Nov 25 10:00 Documents` (`d` is file type ; `rwxr-xr-x` owner,group,others permissions ; `5` no of hard links ; `ckg` is owner ; `ckg` is group ; last modified time stamp ; filename)
  - `ls F*` gives a list of all files starting with F

  - `cd -` takes you to previous directory
  - `cd ~` takes you to home directory
* `cp`
  - copy command : cp file1 file2
* `date`
  - date and time
  - `date -R` gives in RFC 5322 standard (used for email communications)
* `cal`
  - calendar of a month
  - eg : `cal aug 1947`
  - `ncal` gives calendar in flipped orientation
* `free`
  - memory statistics
  - use `h` flag to make it human readable
* `groups`
  - groups to which a user belongs
* `file`
  - what type of file
  - `-f` allows you to pass a file in which file names are separated by lines (ls -1 > files.txt; file -f files.txt)
  - `file *`  will give a list of file name and types directly
* `mkdir` 
  - create a directory
  - default permissions (umask)
* `touch`
  - used to change the last modified timestamp of a file
  - also used to create empty files
* `chmod` 
  - `chmod 777 file.txt`
  - `chmod g-w file.txt` (removes write permissions from the group)
  - `chmod o-x file.txt` (removes executable permission from others)
  - `chmod u-r file.txt` (removes read permission from owner)
* `whoami`
  - prints username
* `less`
  - allows you to read a file page by page
* `ln`
  - used to create a hard link or a symbolic link (symlink) to an existing file or directory
  - `s` flag is used to create a soft link
  - usage : `ln file1 file2` ; `ln -s file1 file2`
* `cat` 
  - stands for concatinate
  - allows you to view the contents of a single file or multiple files (gets concatinated)
### File types 
* output of `ls -l` : `drwxrwxrwx or lr-x--x--x` (l indicates symbolic link and d indicates directory)
* `-` Regular file
* `d` Directory
* `l` Symbolic link
* `c` Character file  (usually found in /dev ; typically the terminal)
* `b` Block file  (usually found in /dev ; typically the hard disk)
* `s` Socket file
* `p` named pipe
### Viewing and Adding to files
* `cat` - to view the contents of a file
* writing to a file : `>` eg : `echo "Hello world" > test.txt`
* appending to a file : `>>` eg : `echo "Helo world" >> test.txt`

### Hard links and Soft links
* inode - An entry in the filesystem table about the location in the storage media
* hard link points to the same inode
* soft link points to a hard link
* hard link must be on the same partition while soft link can point to a file at a totally different geographical location.
* inode is metadata for the file . eg : size ,permissions,blocks etc.
* `ls -i <name>`
* `ln` and `ln -s` is used for creating hard links and soft links 
* inode is unique for every file : if there are multiple entries of inode then it means that they are all hard links
  - if there is a dir level1 with inode = 18874686
  - when you cd into that dir . will also have inode = 18874686
  - if i make a dir level2 inside level1 and then cd into level2 .. will have inode = 18874686 (no of hard links will increase by 1)
  - as number of sub directories increases the number of hardlinks also keeps increasing
* users cannot create hard links for directories (level1 to level2 and level2 to level1 will create a back and forth)
  
### Permissions 
* Files and directories do not inherit the parent directory permissions
* `rwxrwxrwx` (777)
  - 7 rwx
  - 6 rw-
  - 5 r-x
  - 4 r--
  - 3 -wx
  - 2 -w-
  - 1 --x
* rwx rwx rwx : Owner Group Others 
* only owners can change permissions of a file 
* Execute permission is required on a directory to cd into it (Even ls and tocuh to a dir will not work)
* If you want to access a file, all its parent direcories should have **x** permission. This works even without r and w permissions if you know the path.
* r and w permissions along with x is required to ls a directory or touch a file into a directory
* Removing a file works only if it has write permission
  
### Linux Virtual Machine 
* #### ISO 
  - image of Linux OS (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS for x86_64 platform)
* #### Hypervisor 
  - (eg: Oracle VirtualBox or VMWare Workstation Player)
  - A Hypervisor creates and runs virtual machines
  - It allows running multiple operating systems while sharing hardware resources
### Command Line Environments
* Cloud - replit and cocalc
* Phone - Termux by Fredrick Fornwall

### File System of Linux OS
* Filesystem Hirearchy Standard FHS 3.0 (June 03, 2015) (refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/fhs.shtml)
* `/` is root directory and field separator or delimiter for sub-directories
* `.` references the current directory (. is a special file in every directory)
* `..` references the parent directory (.. is a special file in every directory)
* Path for traversal can be absolute or relative
* `boot` directory is where the kernel is located
* `/usr/bin` contains commands that we will use
* `/bin` - essential command binaries
* `/boot` static files of the bootloader
* `/dev` device files (different character in long format of file listing 'c' instead of 'l' or 'd'. 'c' indicates character file - means you can read from it character by character. if first character is 'b' they are block devices typically hdds - the block devices are made available as files.)
* `/etc` Host specific system configuration (.conf files)
* `/lib` Essential shared libraries and kernel modules (Typically contain files with version number at the end)
* `/media` mount points for removable devices 
* `/mnt` mount points 
* `/opt` add on application software packages
* `/run` Data relevant to running processes
* `/sbin` essential system binaries
* `/srv` data for services
* `/tmp` temporary files (normally flushed when system is rebooted)
* `/usr` secondary hierarchy
  - `/usr/bin` : user commands
  - `/usr/lib` : libraries
  - `/usr/local` : local hierarchy
  - `/usr/sbin` : non vital system binaries
  - `/usr/share` : architecture dependent data 
  - `/usr/include` : header files included by c programs
  - `/usr/src` : source code
* `/var` variable data (`/var/log` contains logs for various services)
  - `/var/cache` : Application cache data
  - `/var/lib` : Variable state informtion
  - `/var/local` : variable data for /usr/local
  - `/var/lock` : lock files
  - `/var/log` : log files and directories 
  - `/var/run` : data relevant to running processes
  - `/var/tmp` : temporary files preserved between reboots


|          |    Shareable  |  Unsharable |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
| static   |  `/usr and /opt` | `/etc` and `/boot` |
| variable |    `/var/mail`   |   `/var/run` and `/var/lock` |

## Week 2 Notes

* Multiple uses of / is as good as one
  - ie : `cd usr//////bin` will take you to `usr/bin`
* The root folder / is its own parent
  - ie : if you do `cd ..` within the root directory you stay in the same directory.
* Options / Flags can be written in multiple combinations
  - `ls -l level1 -di`
  - `ls -d level1 -il`
  - `ls level1 -ldi`
  - `ls -ldi level1`
 * long formats for options are also available
  - `ls -a` is equivalent to `ls --all`


### Commands
* `ls`
  - R flag lists all subdirectories recursively 
  - Passing directory name to ls shows what is within that directory. ie : ls -l level1 
  - d flag displays details of a folder without traversing inside it. it : ls -ld level1 
  - 
* `ll`
  - a shortcut for the ls -la command
* `which`
  - which *command* will show the location of the command
  - `which less` will show usr/bin/less
* `whatis`
  - gives a brief description of the command
* `alias` 
  - give a nickname to a frequently used command
  - usage : `alias ll = 'ls -l'`
  - Just typing alias will show a list of aliases
  - `alias date = 'date -R'`
  - If the command is executed by typing the whole path eg : `/usr/bin/date` the alias is not invoked. (`cd /usr/bin` and `./date`)
  - An alias can be escaped by prefixing a \ ie: `\date`
* `unalias` 
  - used to remove an alias
* `rmdir`
  - removes an empty directory
* `ps`
  - displays current processes
  - `ps --forest` - which process has launched which child process.
  - `ps -f` - displays parent process id
  - `ps -ef` - all the processes running in the operating system now
  - PID is the process ID , PPID is the parent process ID.
  - PID 1 is `/sbin/init`
* `bc` - bench calculator 
  - exit using `Ctrl`+`D`

### Commands to know contents of a text file

* `less`
  - displays the content in one screen
  - ls -l /usr/bin/less shows that the command takes 180KB
* `wc`
  - prints newline,word and byte counts for the file
  - the -l flag shows just the number of lines
* `head`
  - head profile displays the first ten lines
  - use -n flag to specify the number of lines
* `tail`
  - tail profile displays the last ten lines
  - use -n flag to specify number of lines to be displayed
* `cat`
  - in /etc , cat profile would just dump contents on the screen without any further prompts.
  - disadvantages : cant move back and forth to view page by page, can't come out half way through.
  - if the file is very long cat is not the best way to look at the content.
* `more`
  - similar to less. Allows page by page viewing
  - ls -l /usr/bin/more shows that the command takes 43KB

### Knowing more commands
* `man`
* `which`
* `apropos`
  - For a keyword it shows you all the commands which have that keyword in the description
  - Used to discover new commands
  - If you type `ls -l /usr/bin/apropos` you see that it is a symbolic link to whatis, but the outputs are different : Why?
  - Reason : In Linux every executable will know in what name it has been invoked - can have different behaviour depending on the name that invoked it.
  - It also has the same output as `man -k` : Searching for a keyword
* `info`
  - Allows browsing through commands using the cursor 
  - Can go back using *<* or 'shift'+','
* `whatis`
* `help`
  - displays keywords reserved for the shell being run
* `type`
  - displays what type of command it is 
  - type type shows that it is a 'shell built in' being offered from the shell and not the os
  - type ls shows that it is aliased with some option. which ls shows that it is coming from os because there is an executable available.
 ### Multiple Arguments
 * ##### Recap : Arguments and Options
  - Options are enhanced features of the command
  - Arguments are specific names of files or directories 
 * Second arrument behaviour and interpratation of last argument should be seen in the man pages
 * Recursion is assumed for `mv` and not `cp`
  - recursion is assumed for some commands and should be explicitly stated in others
  - For copy command recursion is not assumed
  - `cp dir1 dir2` need not work. dir1 has 2 files in it.
  - `cp -r dir1 dir2` works - recursion is specified explicitly.
  - `mv dir1 dir3` works - it just renames the directory.
 * `touch file1 file2 file3` creates all 3 files in one go with identical timestamp.
 
 ### Links (Hard Links and Soft Links)
* Can determine whether a link is HL or SL by looking at the Inode numbers
  - Hard links will have the same inode numbers
  - Soft Link will have different inode numbers 
  - If you delete a certain file using the `rm` command (`rm` unlinks the file from the filesystem. the data is still at the memory location. `shred` for permanant deletion)
    - Its hard link will still give you access to the original file data.
    - Its soft link will not work 
* `ln -s source destination` to create symbolic link. `ln -s file1 file2`
  - file2 is a separate inode entry but it is just a shortcut to file1
  - file2 has only 1 hardlink.
* `ln source destination` to create a hard link . `ln file1 file3`
  - file1 and file 3 have the same inode number - They are basically the same file.
  - file1 and file3 have 2 hard links when we do `ls -li`
* You can create a Soft Link `ln -s ../dir/filex fileSL` but creating a hard link using `ln ../dir/filex fileHL` will not work.
  - the first/source-file parameter is interpreted in the case of hard link creation and not in soft link creation
  - In the above example, assume that `../dir/filex` does not exist.
  - soft links useful in version control systems

### File Sizes 
* `ls -s`
  - file size appears in the first column
* `stat`
  - in `/usr/bin` we look at `stat znew`
  - Gives information about the size, how many blocks are being occupied
  - Here the size is little more than 4kb
  - `stat zmore` shows that it takes less than one block
* `du`
  - in `/usr/bin` we look at `du znew` or `du -h znew`
  - Gives information about the size
  - Here the size is displayed as 8.0KB since there is a block overflow.
  - This means that files that are smaller than the block size will actually take up a whole block
  - `du -h zmore` shows that it occupies one block - around 4.0K
* Role of block size
  - explained in stat and du

### In-Memory File Systems
* `/proc`
  - Is an older system 
  - `ls -l` will display several zero-size files, even though we can read content from them.
  - These are only a representation and not real files on the HDD.
  - `less cpuinfo` - information about the cpu
  - `cat version` - information about the OS. Also accessible using `uname -a`
  - `cat meminfo` - information about the memory - also `free -h`
  - `cat partitions` - information about the partitions - also `df -h` 
  - The `kcore` file appears to take huge space - Shows maximum virtual memory that the current linux os is able to handle. 2^47 or 140 TB
* `/sys`
  - Used from Kernel v2.6 onwards, however information about various processes that are running are still stored in the /proc directory itself.
  - Much more well organised than /proc
  - eg : `sys/bus/usb/devices/1-1` points to a specific usb device. 
* These are directories that are visible in the root folder. They are not on the disk but only in the memory.
* Important system information can be viewed from these directories in a read-only manner.

### Shell Variables 
* Makes it possible to communicate between 2 processes very efficiently. Need not write and read the filesystem.
* Security Concern : Some information that you write to the filesystem may be visible to other processes.
* Shell variables are available only within the shell or its child processes.
* `echo` prints strings to screen
  - uses space as a delimiter so multiple spaces between words are ignored. For multiple spaces, enclose the string in quotes.
  - can print a multi-line string by using double quotes and not closing it
  - ** Difference between ' and " **
  - `echo $USERNAME` and `echo "$USERNAME"` give the same result but `echo '$USERNAME'` is not interpreted to give the value of the shell variable.
  - ** Escaping to prevent interpretation **
  - `echo "username is $USERNAME and host name is \$HOSTNAME"`
  - Escaping is useful when you want to pass on the information to a child shell, without it being interpreted by the shell launching it.
* `echo $HOME` prints values of variables
  - By convention every shell variable starts with a Dollar
* **Commonly used shell variables**
  - `$USERNAME` eg : `echo "User logged into system now is : $USERNAME"`
  - `$HOME`
  - `$HOSTNAME`
  - `$PWD`
  - `$PATH` - variable contains a list of directories which will be searched when you type a command. When ever you type a command the system scans these paths from left to right to see if the command is in the directory.
* Commands like `printenv` , `env` , `set` to see variables that are already defined
  - `printenv` displays all the shell variables defined in the shell that you are running.
  - `env` gives the same output
  - `set` displays some functions defined to interpret what you are typing on the command line.
* **Special Shell Variables**
  - `$0` : name of the shell eg `bash` or `ksh`
  - `$$` : process ID of the shell 
  - `$?` : return code of previously run program
  - `$-` : flags set in the bash shell . The man page for bash shows the meaning of the flags.
* **Process Control** `echo $$`
  - use of `&` to run a job in the background
  - `fg` - bring process to foreground
  - `coproc` - run a command while also being able to use the shell
  - `jobs` - list programs running in the background
  - `top` - See programs that are hogging the CPU or memory (refreshed every second)
  - `kill` - kill process owned by you 
* **Program Exit Codes** `echo $?` 
  - exit code always has a value between *0 and 255*
  - 0 : Success
  - 1 : Failure
  - 2 : Misuse (insufficient permissions)
  - 126 : command cannot be executed (usually due to insufficient permissions to execute a file)
  - 127 : command not found (usually due to command typos)
  - 130 : processes killed using control+c
  - 137 : processes killed using `kill -9 <pid>`
  - If the exit code is more than 256 then the exitcode%256 will be reported as the exit code
  - `exit 0` or `exit 1` or `exit <n>` exits with exit code n
  - Used when there are command dependencies (ie: run second command only if first command completes successfully)
* **Flags set in bash** `echo $-`
  - h : locate hash commands
  - B : braceexpansion enabled
  - i : interactive mode
  - m : job control enabled (can be taken to bg or fg)
  - H : !style history substitution enabled
  - s : commands are read from stdin
  - c : commands are read from arguments

### Linux Process Management
* `sleep` command to create processes
  - usage : `sleep 3` for 3 seconds
* If you have a command running in the Foreground for a long time but you need to write something else on the command line :
  - kill the process
  - suspend the process
  - run it in the background `coproc sleep 10` - When complete it gives a message.
* `coproc` is a shell keyword. No manual entry for it.
  - To learn more about a shell key word use `help coproc`
  - a running background process can be killed by process id (use : `ps --forest` to find PID and `kill -9 <pid>`)
* A command followed by an `&` means that it is being assigned to the background
  - Executing the command `fg` will bring it back to foreground
* `jobs` is a shell builtin - it lists active jobs in the current shell
* `top` shows processes taking up maximum cpu and memory. Exit gracefully by pressing Q
* `Ctrl`+`z` suspends a process.
  - Suspended processes can be seen with `jobs`
  - Can be brought back to foreground using `fg` command
* `Ctrl`+`c` kills a process
* `fg` is a shell builtin
* `bash -c "echo \$-"` creates a child shell, gets the value of `echo $-`, gives the output to the parent shell
  - `bash -c "echo \$-; ps --forest;"` - multiple commands separated by ;
  - `bash -c "echo \$$ ; ps --forest ; exit 300"` : custom error code mod 256 = 44
* `history` displays a list of commands that have been run on that computer
  - `!n` executes command line no n displayed by `history`
  - useful for repeating long commands
  - The `H` flag in bash means the history is being recorded
* Brace expansion option `B`
  - if you type `echo {a..z}` character in the ASCII sequence will be expanded.
  - In combination `echo {a..z}{a..z}` will display all possible combinations of the 2 alphabets.
  - `*` expands to all the files in the current directory
  - `echo D*` lists all the files begining with D.
  - Examples :
    - `mkdir {1..12}{A..E}` or `rmdir {1..12}{A..E}` or `touch {1..12}{A..E}/{1..40}`
* `;` acts as a separator between individual commands eg : `echo hello ; ls`

### REPLIT CODE WITH US
[Link to Replit](https://replit.com/team/22t1SystemCommand)
- `date -d "2024-04-01" +%A` - Day of the week for given date
- `file --mime-type somefile` - mime type of a given file 
- `mkdir {1..12}{A..E}`
- `rmdir {1..12}{A..E}`
- `touch {1..12}{A..E}/{1..40}`
- `lscpu | grep -i "model name"| cut -d ":" -f "2"`

## Week 3 Notes

### Combining Commands and Files
* Executing Multiple Commands
  - `command1; command2; command3;`
    - Each command will be executed one after the other.
  - `command1 && command2`
    - command2 will be executed only if command 1 succeeds
    - If the return code is 0 it is true and if it is greater than 0 it is false
    - `ls && date -Q && wc -l /etc/profile` will display the dir listing followed by error that -Q is invalid; wc is not executed.
  - `command1 || command2`
    - command2 will not be executed if command1 succeeds
    - `ls /blah || date` will display current date after "No such file or directory"
    - `ls || date` will display just the directory listing
    - command2 is like a Plan B if command1 doesn't succeed.
  - Example `ls /blah ; date ; wc -l /etc/profile ;`
  - If we use parenthesis ie `(ls /blah ; date ; wc -l /etc/profile ;)` the command gets executed in a subshell and is returned back to the shell we are using.
  - We can use `echo $BASH_SUBSHELL` to return an integer which tells us at what level of execution we are.
    - `(echo $BASH_SUBSHELL)` will report a value of 1 
    - `(ls; (date; echo $BASH_SUBSHELL))` will report a value of 2
  - Launching too many subshells could be expensive computationally.
* File Descriptors
  - Every command in linux has 3 file descriptors - `stdin` (0) , `stdout` (1), `stderr` (2).
    - `stdin` is a pointer to a stream that is coming from the keyboard or use input
    - `stdout` or `stderr` usually points to the screen where the display or output is made.
    - the three pointers are looking at only the stream of characters.
    - they can be directed to a file or a command, or the default behaviour can be left as it is.
  - Combining a command and a file
    - `command > file1` 
      - `stdout` is redirected to `file1`
      - `file1` will be created if it does not exist
      - if `file1` exists, its contents will be overwritten
      - example : `ls -1 /usr/bin > file1` - displays no output on the screen because there is no error
      - `ls -1 /blah > file1` - displays an error. file1 is overwritten and is now 0 Bytes.
      - `hwinfo > hwinfo.txt`
      - trying this command in a folder where there is no w permissions will generate an error
      - The `cat` command tries to read from the provided file name if not given it tries to read from stdin (keyboard)
        - `cat > file1` will allow you to type content. The feature could be used to create text files on the command line. You can come out using the `Ctrl`+`D` option.
        - `cat file1` displays the content of `file1`
        - `cat` takes input from the keyboard and displays it on the screen (line by line; when you press enter) - Finish by pressing `Ctrl`+`D` to signify end of file.
    - `command >> file1` 
      - contents will be appended to file1
      - new file1 will be created if it does not exist.
      - Example : `date >> file2 ; wc -l /etc/profile >> file2 ; file /usr/bin/znew >> file2 ;`
      - `cat >> file1` to append text to a file from command line. Come out using `Ctrl` + `D`

### Redirections
* combining command and file (continued ..)
  - (contd..)
    - `command 2> file1`
      - redirects `stderr` to `file1`
      - `file1`, if it exists, will be overwritten.
      - `file1` will be created if it does not exist.
      - Example `ls $HOME /blah 2> error.txt`
    - `command > file1 2> file2`
      - `stdout` is redirected to `file1`
      - `stderr` is redirected to `file2`
      - Contents of file1 and file2 will be overwritten.
      - The output is in one file and the errors are in another file.
      - Example : `ls $HOME /blah > output.txt 2> error.txt`
      - `ls -R /etc > output.txt 2> error.txt` - permission related errors in error.txt
    - `command < file1`
      - `stdin` is redirected - a command expecting input from the keyboard could take the input from a file.
      - Example : `wc /etc/profile` behaves similar to `wc < /etc/profile`
    - `command > file1 2>&1`
      - command output will be redirected to `file1`
      - `2>` indicates `stderr` and that is being redirected to `&1` (first stream) which is `stdout`
      - contents of `file1` will be overwritten
      - Example : `ls $ HOME /blah > file1` output alone is sent to file1. Error on screen
      - Example : `ls $ HOME /blah > file1 2>&1` output and error is sent to file1.
    - `command1 | command2` Pipe
      - `stdout` output of command 1 is sent to `stdin` of command2 as input
      - Example `ls /usr/bin | wc -l`
    - `command1 | command2 > file1`
      - command1 and command2 are combined and the `stdout` of command2 is sent to `file1`. Errors are still shown on the screen.
      - Example `ls /usr/bin | wc -l > file1` - file1 has the number of lines counted by wc 
    - `command > file1 2> /dev/null`
      - `/dev/null` file - A sink for output to be discarded. Like a "black hole"
      - We normally don't do anything with the `/dev` folder as there are sensitive system files there.
      - If you are confident that the script is running well and you do not want to display any error on the screen, you can redirect the `stderr` to `/dev/null` 
      - `stderr` is redirected to `/dev/null`
      - Example : `ls $HOME /blah > file1 2> /dev/null`
      - Example : `ls -R /etc > file1 2> /dev/null` - file1 contains the output except errors
    - `command1 | tee file1`
      - Used in sitiations where you want to have a copy of the output in a file as well as on the screen.
      - The `tee` command reads from `stdin` and writes to `stdout` and file/s.
      - Example : `ls $HOME | tee file1` also `ls $HOME | tee file1 file2` for creating multiple copies
      - `diff file1 file2` comapares files line by line
        - no output if the files are identical 
      - Example : `ls $HOME /blah | tee file1 file2 | wc -l` - Here  `tee` keeps copy of output in a file and also sends output to `wc -l` for further processing.
      - Example : `ls $HOME /blah 2> /dev/null | tee file1 file2 | wc -l` to supress errors. Note location of `2>` is since the error is generated there.

### Shell Variables - Part 1

* Creation, inspection, modification, lists
* Creating a variable
  - `myvar="value string"`
    - `myvar` can't start with a number, but you can mix alphanumeric and `_`
    - No space around the `=`
    - `"value string"` is the number,string or `command`. Output of a command can be assigned to myvar by enclosing the command in back-ticks.
* Exporting a variable
  - `export myvar="value string"` or
  - `myvar="value string" ; export myvar`
  - This makes the value of the variable available to a shell that is spawned by the current shell.
* Using variable values
  - `echo $myvar`
  - `echo ${myvar}`
    - can manipulate the value of the variable by inserting some commands within the braces.
  - `echo "${myvar}_something"` 
* Removing a variable
  - `unset myvar`
  - Removing value of a variable `myvar`
* Test if a variable is set
  - `[[ -v myvar ]] ; echo $? `
    - 0 : success (variable myvar is set)
    - 1 : failure (variable myvar is not set)
  - `[[ -z ${myvar+x} ]] ; echo $?`  (the `x` can be any string)
    - 0 : success (variable myvar is not set)  
    - 1 : failure (variable myvar is set)
* Substitute default value
  - If the variable `myvar` is not set, use "default" as its default value
  - `echo ${myvar:-"default"}`
    - if `myvar` is set display its value
    - else display "default"
* Set default value
  - If the variable `myvar` is not set then set "default" as its value 
  - `echo ${myvar:="default"}`
    - if `myvar` is set display its value
    - else set "default" as its value and display its new value
* Reset value if variable is set
  - If the variable `myvar` is set, then set "default" as its value
  - `echo ${myvar:+"default"}`
    - if `myvar` is set, then set "default" as its value and display the new value
    - else display null 
* List of variable names
  - `echo ${!H*}`
    - displays the list of names of shell variables that start with H
* Length of string value
  - `echo ${#myvar}`
    - Display length of the string value of the variable `myvar`
    - if `myvar` is not set then display 0
* Slice of a string value
  - `echo ${myvar:5:4}` (5 is the offset and 4 is the slice length)
    - Display 4 characters of the string value of the variable `myvar` after skipping first 5 characters.
  - if the slice length is larger than the length of the string then only what is available in the string will be displayed.
  - the offset can also be negative. However you need to provide a *space* after the *:* to avoid confusion with the earlier usage of the `:-` symbol. The offset would come from the right hand side of the string.
* Remove matching pattern
  - `echo ${myvar#pattern}` - matches once
  - `echo ${myvar##pattern}` - matches maximum possible
  - Whatever is matching the pattern will be removed and the rest of it will be displayed on the screen.
* Keep matching pattern
  - `echo ${myvar%pattern}` - matches once
  - `echo ${myvar%%pattern}` - matches maximum possible
* Replace matching pattern
  - `echo ${myvar/pattern/string}` - match once and replace with string
  - `echo ${myvar//pattern/string}` - match max possible and replace with string
* Replace matching pattern by location
  - `echo ${myvar/#pattern/string}` - match at begining and replace with string
  - `echo ${myvar/%pattern/string}` - match at the end and replace with string
* Changing case
  - `echo ${myvar,}` - Change the first character to lower case.
  - `echo ${myvar,,}` - Change all characters to lower case.
  - `echo ${myvar^}` - Change first character to uppercase
  - `echo ${myvar^^}` - Change all characters to upper case
  - The original value of the variable is not changed. Only the display will be modified as the trigger commands are within braces.
* Restricting value types
  - `declare -i myvar` - only integers assigned 
  - `declare -l myvar` - Only lower case chars assigned
  - `declare -u myvar` - Only upper case chars assigned
  - `declare -r myvar` - Variable is read only
  - Once a variable is set as read only you may have to restart the bash to be able to set it 
* Removing restrictions
  - `declare +i myvar` - integer restriction removed 
  - `declare +l myvar` - lower case chars restriction removed
  - `declare +u myvar` - upper case chars restriction removed
  - `declare +r myvar` - *Can't do once it is read-only*
* Indexed arrays
  - `declare -a arr`
    - Declare `arr` as an indexed array
  - `$arr[0]=”value”`
    - Set value of element with index 0 in the array
  - `echo ${arr[0]}`
    - Value of element with index 0 in the array
  - `echo ${#arr[@]}`
    - Number of elements in the array. The `@` symbol is a wild character to run through all the elements in the array
  - `echo ${!arr[@]}`
    - Display all indices used
  - `echo ${arr[@]}`
    - Display values of all elements of the array
  - `unset ‘arr[2]’`
    - Delete element with index 2 in the array
  - `arr+=(“value”)`
    - Append an element with a value to the end of the array
* Associative arrays
  - `declare -A hash`
    - declare `hash` as an associative array
  - `$hash[“a”]=”value”`
    - set the value of element with index a in the array
  - `echo ${hash[“a”]}`
    - value of element with index a in the array
  - `echo ${#hash[@]}`
    - number of elements in the array
  - `echo ${!hash[@]}`
    - display all indices used
  - `echo ${hash[@]}`
    - display values of all elements of the array
  - `unset ‘hash[“a”]’`
    - delete an element with index a in the array
  - Can do everything in the indexed array except append because there is nothing called the end of the array as there is no sequence for the elements of a hash
* Examples
  - `true` always returns exit code 0
  - `false` always returns exit code 1 (Check with `echo $?`)
  - To check whether a variable is present
    - `[[ -v myvar ]] ; echo $?` returns 1 if the variable is not present in the memory
    - `[[ -z ${myvar+x} ]] ; echo $? ` returns 0 if variable is not present and 1 if it is present. `x` is a string that will be used as a replacement if the variable was not present.
  - Use of Braces
    - `myvar=FileName`
    - `echo $myvar`
    - `echo "$myvar.txt"` prints FileName.txt
    - `echo "$myvar_txt"` does not print anything as the variable `myvar_txt` does not exist
    - `echo "${myvar}_txt"` prints Filename_txt 
    - Braces are useful in stating clearly the name of the variable.
    - Can also be used outside quotes `echo ${myvar}`
  - Does the variable we have created get passed on to the shell or any other program created within the shell
    - `myvar=3.14 ; echo $myvar`
    - `bash` one more level of bash
    - `ps --forest` to show that we are one level below
    - `echo $myvar` not present
    - Use `export myvar=3.14` to ensure this variable is available to all spawned sub shells.
    - Change value of variable within the child shell
    - modification of value is not reflected in the value of the variable in the parent shell
    - even if you do export of the variable within the child shell it will not change the value within the parent shell.
  - Use of back-ticks
    - `` mydate=`date` `` value of mydate will be output of date.
    - `` mydate=`echo Sunday that is today` ; echo $mydate ``
  - Manipulations for variables within the shell environment
    - We would like to have echo display a default value if variable is not available
    - `` echo ${myvar:-hello} `` the `-` indicates if the value is not present what is the display value
    - `` echo ${myvar:-"myvar is not set"} ``
    - Set the value if it was not set already
    - `` echo ${myvar:=hello} `` if absent / not set then set it to the value after `=`
    - If it is present it will not change
    - `` echo ${myvar:?"myvar is not set"} `` displays a little more information and a debug message. `bash: myvar: myvar is not set`
    - Unset the value of a variable using `unset myvar`
    - ``echo ${myvar:+HELLO}`` displays the message if the variable is present
  - Inspecting all the variables in the shell environment
    - `printenv`
    - `env`
    - `echo ${!H*}` displays the names of variables begining with 'H' - `!` indicates names of the variables instead of value.
  - Counting characters
    - `` mydate=`date` `` stores the output of the `date` command in `mydate`
    - `echo ${#mydate}` prints the length of the value present in mydate.
    - length of a non-existing variable is zero
  - Features of using colon : within braces {}
    - Extracting part of a string from the value of a particular variable.
      - `echo ${mydate:6:10}`
      - `echo ${myvar:3:3}` will print `def` for `myvar=abcdefg` ie: 3 characters after the offset (position 3)
    - Using negative offset
      - `echo ${myvar: -3:3}` and `echo ${myvar: -3:4}` will print `efg` for `myvar=abcdefg`
        - note `-` is to be preceeded with a blank to avoid confusion
        - asking for more characters, will print just what is available
      - `echo ${myvar: -3:2}` will print `ef` for `myvar=abcdefg`
    - Extracting a portion of the date
      - Output of `date` is `Tuesday 25 January 2022 09:10:20 PM IST`
      - Output of `date +"%d %B %Y"` is `25 January 2022`
      - if `` mydate=`date` `` then `echo ${mydate:8:16}` will also print `25 January 2022`
    - Extracting patterns from a string
      - `myvar=filename.txt.jpg`
      - `echo ${myvar#*.}` minimal matching displays `txt.jpg`
      - `myvar=filename.somethingelse.jpeg`
      - `echo ${myvar##*.}` maximal matching displays `jpeg`
      - `echo ${myvar%*.}` displays filename.somethingelse
        - the `%` is used to indicate what has not been matched. (minimal)
      - `echo ${myvar%%*.}` displays filename
        - the `%` is used to indicate what has not been matched. (maximal)
      - Can be combined `echo ${myvar%%.*}.${myvar##*.}` to get `filename.jpeg`
     - Replacing what has been matched
      - Pattern matching in Linux usually goes with a pair of forward slashes.
      - Convert all `e` to `E` in a string
        - `echo ${myvar/e/E}` replaces only the first occurance of `e`
        - `echo ${myvar//e/E}` replaces all occurances of `e`
      - Replace characters at the begining of a string
        - `echo ${myvar/#f/F}` replaces the occurance of `f` in the begining of the string with `F`. The `#` indicates the begining of the string
      - Replace characters at the end of a string
        - `echo ${myvar/%g/G}` replaces the occurance of `g` at the end of the string with `G`. The `%` indicates the end of the string.
      - Replace jpeg with jpg, only if it is at the end of a string
        - `echo ${myvar/%jpeg/jpg}`
     - Modifying and storing it in a variable
        - `` myvar1=`echo ${myvar//jpeg/jpg}` ``
     - Generic command to remove day from date
        - `echo ${mydate#*day}`
     - Upper case to lower case and vice-versa
        - `echo ${mydate,}` changes first character to lowercase
        - `echo ${mydate,,}` converts all characters to lowercase
        - `echo ${mydate^}` changes first character to uppercase
        - `echo ${mydate^^}` changes all characters to uppercase
     - Restricting values that can be assigned to shell variables using `declare`
        - `declare` is a shell builtin
        - `+` to **unset** a restriction and `-` to **set** it  (Note : counterintutuve )
        - `-a` for indexed arrays (need not be ordered indexes)
        - `-A` for associative arrays (dictionaries)
        - `-i` for integers
        - `-u` for uppercase conversion on assignment
        - Integer restriction
            - `declare -i mynum`
            - `mynum=10` will assign 10 to mynum
            - `mynum=hello` will assign 0 to mynum
        - lowercase restriciton
            - `declare -l myvar`
            - `myvar=hello` assigns hello to myvar
            - `myvar=BELLOW` converts BELLOW to lowercase and assigns it to myvar.
        - removing a restriction
            - `declare +l myvar`
            - the value is still contained after removing the restriction but you can now store upper case characters as well
        - declaring a read-only variable
            -  `declare -r myvar`
            -  once a variable has been set as read only, you cannot change its value and you cannot remove the read-only restriction using `+r`
            -  `declare +r myvar` gives the error `bash: declare: myvar: readonly variable`
      - Arrays
        - `declare -a arr`
        - `arr[0]=Sunday`
        - `arr[1]=Monday`
        - `echo ${arr[0]}`
        - `echo ${arr[1]}` 
        - `echo ${#arr[@]}` gives number of elements in the array
        - `echo ${arr[@]}` displays all values
        - `echo ${!arr[@]}` displays the indices`
        - You can have any index without filling up intermediate indices. Indices are not necessarily contiguous.
        - `arr[100]=Friday` is also valid
        - Removing an element from an array = `unset 'arr[100]'`
        - Appending to an array `arr+=(Tuesday)`
        - Populating an array in one go `arr=(Sunday Monday Tuesday)` . The indices are sequential
      - Associative Arrays / Hashes
        - `declare -A hash`
        - `hash[0]="Amal"`
        - `hash["mm12b001"]="Charlie"`
        - `echo ${!hash[@]}` to get indices
        - `echo ${hash["mm12b001"]}`
      - File names in a shell variable 
        - ``myfiles=(`ls`) ``
        - `echo ${myfiles[@]}`

### Week 4 Notes

#### Software Management
* Using Package Management Systems 
  - Tools for installing, updating, removing and managing software
  - Install new / updated software across network
  - Package - File look up, both ways 
    - Which files are given by a particular package and which package contains a given file
  - Database of packages on the system including versions (compatibility and requirements)
  - Dependency checking
  - Signature verification tools (to check authenticity of source of the software)
  - Tools for building packages (to build packages from soure code - particularly true for kernel modules)

* Package types 
  - Package
    - RPM
      - Red Hat
        - CentOS
        - Fedora
        - Oracle Linux
      - SUSE Enterprise Linux
        - OpenSUSE
    - DEB
      - Debian
        - Ubuntu
          - Mint
        - Knoppix
* Commands
  - `lsb_release -a` to find version of Operating System
  - When searching for packages for this version of the OS you can search by OS code name eg: `focal`
* Architectures
  - amd64 | x86_64
  - i386 | x86
  - arm (RISC5 Sakthi)
  - ppc64el | OpenPOWER
  - all | noarch |src (not tied to any architecture)
* Commands
  - `uname -a` gives the kernel version and the type of architecture.
* Tools 
	- Package Type
		- RPM
			- Yellowdog Updater Modifier (yum)
				- Red Hat Package Manager (rpm)
				- Dandified YUM (dnf)
		- DEB
			-  synaptic (GUI)	
			-  aptitude (Command Line)
				- Advanced Package Tool (apt)
					- dpkg
						- dpkg-deb
* Package managemet in Ubuntu using `apt`
	- Inquiring package db
		- Search packages for a keyword
			- `apt-cache search keyword`
		- List all packages
			- `apt-cache pkgnames`
			- `apt-cache pkgnames | sort | less` for page by page sorted display
			- `apt-cache pkgnames nm` for all packages starting with nm
		- Display package records of a package
			- `apt-cache show -a package`

* Package Names
	- Package
		- RPM
			- package-version-release.architecture.rpm
		- DEB
			- package_version-revision_architecture.deb
			- eg : `pool/universe/n/nmap/nmap_7.80+dfsg1-2build1_amd64.deb`
* Package Priorities
	- required : essential to proper functioning of the system
	- important : provides functionality that enables the system to run well
	- standard : included in a standard system installation
	- optional : can omit if you do not have enough storage
	- extra : could conflict with packages with higher priority, has specialized requirements, install only if needed.
	- Priority is displayed as `extra` in the output of `apt-cache show nmap` or `apt-cache show wget` for example.
* Package Sections
	- [Package Sections for Ubuntu focal](https://packages.ubuntu.com/focal/)
	- `apt-cache show fortunes` shows `Section : universe/games`
* Checksums
	- For a small change in the original file the checksum is very different. This is useful to chack if the original file has been tampered or not. 
	- Can be used to verify that nothing has gone wrong to the contents of the file while downloading. 
	- md5sum 
		- 128 bit string
		- `md5sum filename`
	- SHA1
		- 160 bit string
		- `sha1sum filename`
	- SHA256
		- 256 bit string
		- `sha256sum filename`

4.2
* Who can install packages in Linux OS ?
	- administrators
	- sudoers in the case of Ubuntu
	- Only sudoers can install/upgrade/remove packages
	- a sudo command can be executed by those who are listed in `/etc/sudoers`
	- Command `sudo cat /etc/sudoers` . If the current `$USER` is not in the sudoers file the incident will be reported.
	- In the file the users listed under `# User privilege specification` have sudo permission.
	- sudo attempts and authentication failures get recorded in `/var/log/auth.log`. View using `sudo tail -n 100 /var/log/auth.log`
* When installing a package the system knows the website/server from which the packages have to be downloaded
	- This information is stored in the folder `/etc/apt`
	- Uncommented lines in the file `sources.list` have the debian/ubuntu sources 
	- A directory `sources.list.d` stores sources for third party software. Allows `apt update` to know new versions to download from repositories stored in these files
	- Synchronize package overview files - `sudo apt-get update` fetches updates and keeps them in cache
	- Upgrade all installed packages - `sudo apt-get upgrade` upgrades the packages. It lists how many updates are going to be affected and how much data is going to be downloaded.
	- `sudo apt autoremove` to remove unused packages that were earlier installed to satisfy a particular dependency but are not needed now.
	- Install a package - `sudo apt-get install packagename`
	- `sudo apt-get remove packagename` to remove a particular package
	- `sudo apt-get reinstall packagename` to fix problems caused by accedential file deletions.
	- Clean local repository of retreived package files - `apt-get clean`
	- Purge package files from the system - `apt-get purge package`
* Package management in Ubuntu using `dpkg`
	- Allows installation directly from a `.deb` file. Package management at a lower level.
	- `/var/lib/dpkg` has some information about the packages
		- Files - `arch`,`available`,`status`
			- `cat arch` displays the architectures for which packages have been installed on the system - `amd64`,`i386`
			- `less available` displays list of packages with info. 
			- `less status` displays if a particular package is installed or not
		- Folder - `info`
			- contains a set of files for each of the packages that have been installed
			- `ls wget*` will give files with information about `wget`
				- `more wget.conffiles`gives location of configuration file 
				- `more wget.list` displays list of files that would get installed on the system with the package
				- `more wget.md4sums` displays the listof md5sums of the installed files. (Used to catch tampering)
* Using `dpkg`
	- List all packages whose names match the pattern
		- `dpkg -l pattern`
	- List installed files that came from packages
		- `dpkg -L package`
	- Display/Report the status of packages
		- `dpkg -s package`
	- Search installed packages for a file
		- `dpkg -S pattern` 
		- eg : `dpkg -S /usr/bin/perl` shows the package from which the executable has come. ie : `perl-base`
	- To query the dpkg database about all the packages - `dpkg-query`
		- Example `dpkg-query -W -f='${Section} ${binary:Package}\n' | sort | less`
		- Example where output is filtered `dpkg-query -W -f='${Section} ${binary:Package}\n' | grep shells`
* Installing a deb package
	- `dpkg -i package_version-revision_architecture.deb`
	- not a good idea since it may have some dependencies that will have to be taken care of manually
	- Do not download deb files from unknown sources and install it on the system
	- By default use package management pointing to a reliable repository
	- Uninstalling packages using `dpkg` is NOT recommended. You may be removing a package that is required by many other packages.
* When compatibility issues cannot be resloved one can use `snap` or `docker` as alternatives when you are unable to install a particular version of a package.

4.3

#### Pattern Matching
* Regular Expressions `regex` and `grep` commands
	- POSIX standard
		- IEEE 1003.1-2001 IEEE Standard for IEEE Information Technology – Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX(TM))
		- [Refer](https://standards.ieee.org/standard/1003_1-2001.html)
	- POSIX defines regular expressions to be of 2 different types - Basic and Extended.
* Regex
	- regex is a pattern template to filter text
	- BRE: POSIX Basic Regular Expression engine
	- ERE: POSIX Extended Regular Expression engine
* Why learn regex?
	- PRocess some input from the user or perform some string operations.
	- Languages: Java, Perl, Python, Ruby, ...
	- Tools: grep, sed, awk, ...
	- Applications: MySQL, PostgreSQL, ...
* Usage
	- `grep ‘pattern’ filename` - to operate on every line in the file
	- `command | grep ‘pattern’`
		- the `grep` command operates line after line. A common feature in many utilities in linux.
		- enclose pattern in single quotes 
	- Default engine: BRE
	- Switch to use ERE in 2 ways:
		- `egrep ‘pattern’ filename`
		- `grep -E ‘pattern’ filename`

* ### Examples using grep
	- [Example File names.txt (Containing Names/Roll-No)](Example_Files/names.txt)
	- Basic use
		- `grep 'Raman' names.txt` matches line with Raman Singh
		- `cat names.txt | grep 'ai'` matches line with Snail
	- Usage of `.`
		- `cat names.txt | grep 'S.n'` matches lines with Singh and Sankaran
	- Usage of `$`
		- `cat names.txt | grep '.am$' ` matches lines that end with xam
	- Escaping a `.`
		- `cat names.txt | grep '\.'` matches lines that have a `.`
	- Using anchors at the begining
		- `cat names.txt | grep '^M'` matches lines begining with m
	- Case insensitive matching with the `i` flag
		- `cat names.txt | grep -i '^e'` matches lines begining with e or E.
	- Word boundaries `\b`
		- `cat names.txt | grep 'am\b'` matches lines with words that end with 'am'
	- Use of square brackets `[]` to give options
		- `cat names.txt | grep 'M[ME]'` matches lines containing 'MM' or 'ME'
		- `cat names.txt | grep '\bS.*[mn]'` matches lines containing words begining with S and ending with m or n.
		- `cat names.txt | grep '[aeiou][aeiou]'` matches lines that have 2 vowels side by side
		- `cat names.txt | grep 'B90[1-4]'` matches words begining with B90 and ending with range 1-4. 
		- `cat names.txt | grep 'B90[^1-4]'` matches words begining with B90 and ending with characters other than the range 1-4. A hat inside square brackets implies negation
	 - Specifying occurances using escaped braces
	 	- `cat names.txt | grep 'M\{2\}'` matches lines which have 'MM'
	 	- `cat names.txt | grep 'M\{1,2\}'` matches lines which have one or 2 'M's
	 - Grouping patterns that are matched using parenthesis. Repeating whatever is matched by using `\1`
	 	- `cat names.txt | grep '\(ma\)'` matches lines containing 'ma'
	 	- `cat names.txt | grep '\(ma\).*\1'` matches a pattern begining with 'ma' and ending with 'ma' eg: U'mair Ahma'd. The `\1` back-references the first parenthesis.
	 	- `cat names.txt | grep '\(.a\).*\1'` matches a pattern like 'Mary Ma'nickam
	 	- `cat names.txt | grep '\(a.\)\{3\}'` matches a pattern like S'agayam'
	 - Using Extended Regular Expression Engine
	 	- `cat names.txt | egrep 'M+'` will match lines where M occures one or more times.
	 	- `cat names.txt | egrep '^M+'` will match lines where M occures one or more times at the begining of a line.
	 	- `cat names.txt | egrep '^M*'`
	 		- `cat names.txt | egrep '^M*a'` matches lines where 'M' may or may not occur followed by 'a'
	 		- `cat names.txt | egrep '^M.*a'` matches lines where 'M' has to occur at the begining of a line followed by any number of characters and ending with 'a'
	 		- Watch out for the interpretation of `*`
	 	- `cat names.txt | egrep '(ma)+'` 'ma' could occur one or more times.
	 	- `cat names.txt | egrep '(ma)*'` 'ma' could occur zero or more times.
	 - Use of pipe as an alternation between 2 patterns of strings to be matched
	 	- `cat names.txt | egrep '(ED|ME)'` matches lines containing 'ED' or 'ME'
	 	-  `cat names.txt | egrep '(Anu|Raman)'` matches lines containing 'Anu' or 'Raman'. Length of string on both sides of pipe need not be the same.
	 	-  `cat names.txt | egrep '(am|an)$'` matches lines containing 'am' or 'an' at the end.

* ### More Examples using grep and egrep
	- Get package names that are exactly 4 characters long
		- `dpkg-query -W -f'${Section} ${binary:Package}\n' | egrep ' .{4}$'`
	- Get package names that are from the math section
		- `dpkg-query -W -f'${Section} ${binary:Package}\n' | egrep '^math'`
	- [Example File chartype.txt (Containing few lines with control character)](Example_Files/chartype.txt)	
		- control character inserted using `echo $'\cc' >> chartype.txt`
	- get lines that have an alphanumeric character at the begining of the line
		- `cat chartype.txt | grep '^[[:alnum:]]'`
	- get lines that have digits at the end of the line
		- `cat chartype.txt | grep '[[:digit:]]$'`
	- get lines that have a ctrl character
		- `cat chartype.txt | grep '[[:ctrl:]]'`
		- `cat chartype.txt | grep -v '[[:cntrl:]]'` will show the reverse including the empty lines
	- get lines that do not have a ctrl character
		- `cat chartype.txt | grep '[^[:cntrl:]]'` (This does not work as intended)
	- get lines that have printable characters (exclude blank lines)
		- `cat chartype.txt | grep '[[:print:]]'`
	- get lines that have blank space characters (exclude blank lines)
		- `cat chartype.txt | grep '[[:blank:]]'`
	- `[[:graph:]]` is used to match any non space character
	- To skip blank lines
		- `cat chartypes.txt | egrep -v '^$'` Here `-v` excludes and `'^$'` captures empty lines
	- Identify a line with a 12 digit number
		- `egrep '[[:digit:]]{12}' patterns.txt`
	- Identify a line with a 6 digit number (Use word boundaries)
		- `egrep '\b[[:digit:]]{6}\b' patterns.txt`
	- Match lines containing Roll Number of the form MM22B001
		- `egrep '\b[[:alpha:]]{2}[[:digit:]]{2}[[:alpha:]][[:digit:]]{3}\b' patterns.txt`
	- Match urls without the http
		- `egrep '\b[[:alnum:]]+\.[[:alnum:]]+\b' patterns.txt`
	- **Trimming text**
		- top to bottom using `head` and `tail`
		- sidways or horizontal trimming of lines using `cut`
			- `cut -c 1-4 fields.txt` displays only first 4 characters. Can also use `-4` for begining to 4th place or `2-` to cut from 2nd place to end.
			- `cat fields.txt | cut -d " " -f 1` - This uses " " as a delimiter `-d` and prints only the first field `-f 1`
			- `cat fields.txt | cut -d ' ' -f 1-2` - to get both fields
			- Capture `hello world` from `1234;hello world,line 1`
				- `cat fields.txt | cut -d ';' -f 2 | cut -d "," -f 1`
				- `egrep ';.*,' fields.txt` (To trim pass the output of grep to `sed`)
			- Combining this with top to bottom trimming
				- `cat fields.txt | cut -d ';' -f 2 | cut -d "," -f 1 | head -n 2 | tail -n 1`

* ### Own experiments using regex

* ### REPLIT Code with Us session
	- Getting files with a specific permission pattern from a file
		- `cat lsinfo.txt | grep 'rw-r--r--' ;`
	- Get all files excluding directories in lsinfo.txt whose last modified date is in January

	- to display all the lines that does not contain the word "we" in it
		- `cat twocities.txt | egrep -v '\bwe\b'`
	- using cut to display only the countries and its capitals of file.txt in the format Country, Capital (eg in file.txt : India, New Delhi; Asia)
		- `cat file.txt | cut -d ';' -f 1 `
	- all the countries in the file file.txt sorted alphabetically by name in reverse order
		- `cat file.txt | cut -d ',' -f 1 | sort -r`
	- cut command to extract the continents (including the one white space in the beginning) of the first 5 lines of file.txt and store it in another file named continent.txt
		- `head -n 5 file.txt | cut -d ';' -f 2 > continent.txt `
	- list the names of all the c++ files in the current directory which contains a line such that the line starts with the string void main() and ends with the character {. There should be one or more spaces/tabs between the characters { and ).
		- `egrep '^void[[:space:]]main\(\)[[:space:]]+{$' *.cpp | cut -d '.' -f 1`
		- `grep '^void[[:space:]]main()[[:space:]][[:space:]]*{$' *.cpp | cut -d '.' -f 1`
	-  print the count of these files in the following line
		- `egrep -l '^void[[:space:]]main\(\)[[:space:]]+{$' *.cpp |tee /dev/tty | wc -l ` 
		- `|tee /dev/tty` is used to print the output to terminal and also pipe the output to the next command.
		- `-l` flag for `grep` and `egrep` prints the name of each input file that matches 
	- command to list all the packages installed on your machine and their versions in the format Package Version in a sorted manner
		- `dpkg-query -W -f='${Package} ${Version}\n' | sort`
